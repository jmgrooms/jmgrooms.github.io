          <h3 class="postTitle">Top 2 Things To Do While Visiting Springfield, MO</h3>
          <div class="postContent">
            <p>
              1. Spend, at least, an entire afternoon wandering around Bass Pro Shops
            </p>
            <p>
              If you didn't know, Bass Pro Shops was originally started in
              Springfield, MO. Located on the corner of East Sunshine St. and
              South Campbell Ave. it's the largest in the World. An entire
              afternoon might not be enough time to see it all, but it's a
              great start.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Get yourself a plate of cashew chicken
            </p>
            <p>
              It's the unofficial dish of my beloved hometown, and an
              absolute <em>cannot miss</em> when you visit. Do your mouth a
              favor a go get some!

          <h3 class="postTitle">Why I Love Cashew Chicken</h3>
          <div class="postContent">
            <p>
              I'm originally from Springfield, MO, <em><strong>the</strong></em>
              birthplace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew_chicken#Springfield-style_cashew_chicken">
              cashew chicken</a>, and have eaten a plate of the delectable dish
              at least once a month for as far back as I can remember.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, you don't have to have been born and raised in my hometown
              to appreciate those beautiful golden fried nuggets of chicken,
              coverd in a savory brown sauce, and topped with cashews and
              chopped green onions. All you have to do is visit Springfield, MO,
              the only place on Earth where you can find authentic cashew
              chicken, and get a plate of it yourself. One bite and you too
              shall sing it praise!
